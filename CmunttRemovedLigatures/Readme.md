CMUTypewriter-Rglr-NoL
======================

Based on cmuntt.ttf (Computer Modern Unicode Typewriter) version 0.7.0

Removed all ligatures because windows 10 decided it wants to render ligatures like fi, fj, ff even in *monospaced* fonts which made editing code difficult. Technically, I only had an issue with `ff`, `fj`, `fi`, `ij` and `->` but it's safer to just get rid of all of them.
