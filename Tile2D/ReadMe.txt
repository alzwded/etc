Tile2D
======

Very basic skeleton which can e.g. be transformed into a graphics skeleton project for use in teaching.

It has two components, a 40x30 tile drawing canvas on the top and a time series graph on the bottom.

To turn this into a skeleton project:
* load bitmaps instead of using brushes
* load bitmaps at startup
* use more than one time series in the graph

That's for another day
