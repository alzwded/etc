I forget what this actually does and what it was supposed to do... I found it in my inbox from long ago.

There were notes:
```no-highlight
what to do next:
1) after first encoding pass, reverse the output string and reencode
2) add a const char* key and also use that in encode

idem for decode, it's symmetrical ffs
```

I have no idea what that means.

I need to take time one day to re-figure out what it does.

I remember working on this during lunch breaks in belgium.

I like the Makefile, though.
