2048
====

My very own C++/C/SDL implementation of the 2048 game. TODO give credit, I forgot who did it originally.

This project lives at http://github.com/alzwded/etc/
However, the test-project lives at: http://chiselapp.com/user/alzwded/repository/etc/dir?name=t2048&type=tree

Why another repo
================

Because I like the original version and I feel adding unit tests for everything will promote implementation details to requirements and specifications instead of them remaining just implementation details. Thus, we will be able to compare and contrast the two (in the future, different) implementations.

Consider this a fork.

Playing
=======

You can either experiment with building this turkey yourself, or you can grab it from the release section of the githubg page here: https://github.com/alzwded/etc/releases/tag/jak2048v1.0

Have fun!
